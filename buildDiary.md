# Build Diary

Day 1 - July 11
###

Alright. I have effectively two weeks to work on this app, but I also need to be building my portfolio site in the meantime. Since I've already got my github pages working and I think I'll be able to get everything ported over without too much issue, I'll spend the first couple active build days just working with ASP.NET and seeing if I can get a simple backend API up and running. 

The first issue I ran into was the fact that the setup for running a compiled language in VSCode is a little wonky - reading into the github issues provided a bit more clarity. I'm doing the api builder tutorial for C# and am really excited to be working with a language like this. I'll append the links I'm using below:
