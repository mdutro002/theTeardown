# Build Diary

Alriight. I have effectively two weeks to work on this app, but I also need to be building my portfolio site in the meantime. Since I've already got my github pages working and I think I'll be able to get everything ported over without too much issue, I'll spend the first couple active build days just working with ASP.NET and seeing if I can get a simple backend API up and running.
