# Build Diary

Day 1 - July 11
###

Alright. I have effectively two weeks to work on this app, but I also need to be building my portfolio site in the meantime. Since I've already got my github pages working and I think I'll be able to get everything ported over without too much issue, I'll spend the first couple active build days just working with ASP.NET and seeing if I can get a simple backend API up and running. 

The first issue I ran into was the fact that the setup for running a compiled language in VSCode is a little wonky - reading into the github issues provided a bit more clarity. I'm doing the api builder tutorial for C# and am really excited to be working with a language like this. I'll append the links I'm using below:

Day 3 - July 14
###

After trying to work through a few tutorials on how to build a web api using ASP.NET and running into setup problems, I have switched to a PERN stack for my final project and am looking to build out the backend API and Auth this week. I'm still interested in working with ASP.NET (or C#) at some point, but that'll have to be more of a hobbyist application. I started up a trello board and am using that to keep me on track, I know that leaving room for ambiguity in what I need to accomplish is a great way to set myself up for failure. But I'm much more optimistic about how this project is going to go! I've built plenty of express apps before and I think I get get most of the main api knocked out today and tomorrow. Next step after that would be getting basic routing done and tackling auth. 

I've built out the basics of this but I'm so confused.

Day 5 - July 16

The past few days have been an utter slog. I really should be doing a better job with keeping everything in a sensible manner and doing more frequent commits, but it's just been a problem for me this past week. I'm going to try to keep going. At least for right now I know I'm connecting to the DB and can have both servers up and running but this is taking a lot longer than I'd like and I'm worried the final project is going to be terrible. Huge props to Eric for helping me get the create-react-app running properly though.
